# Overview

**RadJAX** is a JAX-based, differentiable line radiative transfer framework
for modeling emission from protoplanetary disks. It provides GPU‑accelerated
forward models and gradients for high‑dimensional inference and large surveys.

- **Fast**: JAX/XLA on CPU/GPU
- **Differentiable**: gradient‑based inference and ML integration
- **Astronomy‑ready**: molecular line modeling (e.g., ALMA CO)
